#BranchFeed

BranchFeed (soon to be renamed) is an anti-social network allowing users to interact with people outside of their usual group of friends/family.  Users are randomly assigned a group, and can create/join more groups if desired.  The system is loosely based on FaceBook; however, it's not intended to be a ripoff, and will likely drift as development continues.
